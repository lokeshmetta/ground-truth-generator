# Script Changes for package.json

When setting up Docusaurus, the following scripts need to be updated in package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "docusaurus": "docusaurus",
  "start": "docusaurus start",
  "build": "docusaurus build",
  "swizzle": "docusaurus swizzle",
  "deploy": "docusaurus deploy",
  "clear": "docusaurus clear",
  "serve": "docusaurus serve",
  "write-translations": "docusaurus write-translations",
  "write-heading-ids": "docusaurus write-heading-ids"
}
```

This file is for reference only as we cannot directly modify package.json through the chat interface.
